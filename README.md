# ExpressWorks

This repository hosts my solutions for the [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io)'s workshop [ExpressWorks](https://github.com/azat-co/expressworks)

## Solutions

1. ### Hello World

  Create an Express.js app that outputs "Hello World!" when somebody goes to `/home`.

  The port number will be provided to you by expressworks as the first argument of
  the application, i.e., `process.argv[2]`.

  [Solution](hello-world/)
